# 1.PROJECT_PM2.5-PREDICTION
The project focuses on developing a regressive robust machine learning model for predicting PM2.5.
Project focus: Investigating the correlation between meteorological factors and air quality
Goal: Develop data-informed policies to mitigate pollution-related health and environmental risks
Data sources: AQmesh air quality data from Hendon pod measuring facility, weather data from visual crossing website (1-year period)
Findings: Strong correlation between meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, wind direction) and air pollutants
Hypothesis: Significant relationship between meteorological factors and air pollution
Methodology: Pearson correlation analysis, regression model to predict PM2.5 based on meteorological factors
Results: Model performance: RMSE 5.2, R-Squared 0.80; Temperature and visibility key factors (over 50% feature importance)
Conclusion: Confirmed hypothesis; Future work includes comprehensive data collection and analysis of health/environmental impacts of specific pollutants.
